# tsc-fundamentals
This repository contains a basic introduction to TypeScript, including syntax, data types, functions.

# Getting Started

# Syntax
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so it includes all the syntax of JavaScript as well as some additional features. Some of the key features of TypeScript syntax include:

* Static typing
* Interfaces
* Enumerations
* Type aliases
* Generics

# Data Types
TypeScript supports all the data types of JavaScript, as well as some additional ones, such as:

`any`
`void`
`null`
`undefined`
`never`
`tuple`
TypeScript also supports type inference, so you don't always have to explicitly specify the data type of a variable.
